I used to be an ambitious boy, but now my dream is simple.
Do a job I like, meet a nice girl, get married, maybe even have children.
Back to my hometown in my forties, live with my parents, bulid a house where I was born, repair the house like my father, fish in the river as in my childhood, walk along the river bank with my family, read books in the middle of night in snowy winter, pick fruits in the courtyard in summer.
That's it.
